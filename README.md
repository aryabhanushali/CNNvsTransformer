# CNNvsTransformer

This project explores how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) process visual information across different layers. We compare their internal representations using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), revealing how features evolve from low-level to high-level.
